## Getting Started
  
The course is based on [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which allow
a high-level of interactive learning, as code, text description and 
visualisation is combined in one place. If you have not worked with 
`Jupyter Notebooks` before, you can look at the module 
[Introduction to Python and Project Jupyter](./welcome_to_wekeo_jupyterlab.ipynb) 
to get a short introduction to the WEkEO Jupyter Lab workspace.

### Prerequisites
 
If you are working on a local machine, you will require Jupyter notebook to run this code. We recommend that you install the
latest Anaconda Python distribution for your operating system (https://www.anaconda.com/). 
Anaconda Python distributions include Jupyter Notebook. We recommend setting up an
environment as recommended below, however you may also adapt your current Python 
environment to include the dependencies listed.
